Hi I'm Farzam. I'm in my third year at Harvard Law School and I'm cross registered in Machine learning and programming classes at MIT. I'm driven by unending curiosity. Right now I'm particularly interested in AI/ML, law, economics, blockchain, politics, philosophy, and altruism to name a few subjects. Here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farzamkarimi) for more information.

Follow this site for updates on my life and posts on topics I'm thinking about. Also feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to chat about something you're passionate about.
