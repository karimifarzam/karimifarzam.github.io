I'm driven by curiosity, a love for problem solving, and a dedication to forming a more creative, free, and peaceful world. I'm a recent graduate of the Juris Doctorate program at Harvard law school where I was also cross registered in Machine learning and Computer Science classes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I also have a Bachelor's in Health Science from McMaster University. I have a wide variety of interests such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Law, Biotech, Economics, Blockchain, Policy, and Philosophy. My efforts are particularly focused on decentralized artificial intelligence and in policies that ensure an equitable transition to a post artificial general intelligence (AGI) world. I am currently a research affiliate at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics was most recently a legal scholar at Blockchain Capital where I researched AI blockchain regulation. 

I post updates on my work and share my thoughts on topics I'm interested in on my blog. Reach out to me if you have any questions about my work or if you'd just like to chat.
